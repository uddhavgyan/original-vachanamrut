# 71st Tarang 

> **Introductory Shloka**  
> *The offence of enmity towards a devotee is unforgivable by Lord Shri Hari (Shri Krishna). The principle accepted as siddhanta is that Lord Hari is always with form (sakar). ॥1॥*  
> *The oneness of Shri Hari’s divine nature (divine form) and human-like nature (human sentiment or human-like form) – all these topics are clearly described in this 71st tarang. ॥2॥*

**शकेति**  
On the Krishna Chaturthi tithi of Chaitra month in Shak Samvat 1876, this nectar-like discourse of Shri Hari took place. ॥1॥

**तत्रेति**  
On that very tithi, in Durgapur, in the fort of King Uttam, on the platform in front of the west-facing main gate of the excellent royal palace, on a supreme seat covered with fine bedding and sheets, Shri Hari arrived from His residence when six ghatikas (about two and a half hours) of the day remained and sat down (became seated). ॥2॥

**सितेति**  
Shri Hari, whose all garments were white and of fair colour like a swan (maral), was surrounded in the assembly by His dependent devotees – sadhus, munis, and householders – who had come from many countries. He was listening with full concentration and dramatic sentiment to the honoured devotional singing accompanied by veena and other instruments performed by munis such as Muktanand and Premanand. ॥3॥

**कृष्णेति**  
Pleased by hearing generous verses composed by poets like Brahmanand marked with the glory of Shri Krishna, Shri Hari Himself, without being asked by anyone, said to His devotees seated in the assembly – O devotees! If any devotee has any doubt in mind, let him ask. ॥4॥

**सोमवर्मेति**  
Thereafter, Somavarma, the lord king of Buttpur, with folded hands in reverence (kritanjali), bowed to Shri Hari and asked Him – O Hare! Your embodied devotees constantly commit many offences against You, the manifest Purushottam Shri Hari. Those offences are known from the Arthadeepika commentary on Shikshapatri “shaili va dhatuja murtiri”ti (Shikshapatri shloka 56) as “yanena va padukabhya”mityadi (i.e., placing the murti on a vehicle, wearing sandals, etc.). ॥5॥

**त्वमिति**  
O treasury of welfare (kalyan-nidhe)! This attribute is full of reason. You, Shri Hari, forgive their offences due to affection for devotees (bhakta-vatsalya). Among those offences, is there any offence that is unforgivable by You, or is there no such offence? ॥6॥

**इतीति**  
When asked in this manner by Somavarma, Shri Hari said to that king named Somavarma – O King! The true Lord Shri Krishna forgives all offences of His devotee except one single droha (enmity towards a devotee), but <mark1>the offence in the form of bhakta-droha</mark1> He never tolerates; He does not even count other offences. ॥7॥

**अत इति**  
Therefore, <mark>one who worships that Shri Hari should never commit even the slightest offence in the form of droha towards a devotee</mark> – neither physical (kayik), nor verbal (vachik), nor mental (manasik). If done so, one will have to wander repeatedly in samsara. ॥8॥

**किञ्चेति**  
Moreover (kinch), among all the described offences, refuting the eternally established divine form of Shri Krishna – that is, declaring those <mark1>Shri Krishna</mark1> residing in <mark1>His own Akshardham</mark1> to be <mark>formless, made by tantra, or mayamaya, thus stating complete absence of form and establishing as amorphous</mark> – this should be known as <mark1>mahaparadh</mark1>. Such a mahaparadh should never be committed. ॥9॥

**निज इति**  
O King! In His own supreme (beyond root prakriti) <mark1>Akshar-named dham</mark1>, which is far more radiant than crores of suns etc., always with divine form, endowed with charming transcendental limbs, possessed of infinite powers, the supreme Purushottam Bhagavan <mark1>Shri Krishna resides</mark1>, superior even to Akshar-Purush etc. ॥10॥

**मुक्तैरिति**  
Served with divine offerings at proper times by liberated souls whose form is supremely beautiful and brahmamaya, He shines with the splendour of the king of kings. That same Shri Krishna with infinite powers, out of grace and compassion for devotees, concealing His supreme divine powers, manifests on this earth (in the human world on the Indian subcontinent) in human-like form. ॥11॥

**ब्रह्मरूप इति**  
He is brahmarupa because He bestows Brahman to His worshippers merely by relationship, like a touchstone; hence amayik (beyond maya). His that body appears human-like in the view of ordinary people as if produced from five elements and material, but in reality it is the very body of Shri Krishna – not material but exactly divine as it is in Akshardham here too – understand this definitely. ॥12॥

**चतुर्विशति तत्त्वानि**  
Twenty-four tattvas (works of tamo, rajo, sattva gunas – bhuta, indriya, devata etc.), three bodies (sthula, sukshma, karana) and three states (jagrat, svapna, sushupti) – all these appear in Shri Krishna's body to ordinary eyes, but due to being the great brahmarupa, they are amayik (beyond maya) only, this is certain. As said in Vishnu Purana – 'without defects, full of qualities, self-dependent, devoid of inert body qualities, with limbs like hands-feet-face-belly of mere ananda, without internal differences everywhere'. ॥13॥

**इतीति**  
In this way, after answering the question of King Somavarma, keeping in mind the siddhantas of Ramanuja and Shankaracharya who debate sakar-nirakar, to fulfill His own intention (to show Ramanuja mat as dear), Shri Hari asked the great sadhus like Muktanand etc. – although the form of Bhagavan is eternally established from shruti etc., yet some not understanding the purport of shruti consider Bhagavan nirakar, others understanding shruti secrets consider Him sakar, among them Shankara and Ramanuja acharyas are prominent, to show Ramanuja siddhanta as dear, this question was asked. ॥14॥

**सन्त इति**  
O saints! I ask you something, hear and answer. Ramanuja (Shri Lakshmanacharya) and Shankara (Shankaracharya) both great acharyas are world-famous. ॥15॥

**परस्परेति**  
In this world, the siddhantas of Ramanuja and Shankara are mutually contradictory. The first Ramanujacharya mat is that Brahman Shri Krishna Bhagavan is sakar and always with eternally established divine form. The second Shankaracharya mat is that Brahman is nirakar, tejomaya and without linga. ॥16॥

**कतरदिति**  
Among these two mats, which mat is dear (abhimat) in your hearts, O gentlemen? When asked thus, munis like Muktanand, without transgressing shastra, gave definite answer to Shri Hari accordingly. ॥17॥

**साकारमिति**  
O Hare! <mark>In which Ramanujacharya mat, Brahman named Krishna is said to be sakar and always with eternally established divine form, that mat is dear to us.</mark> (By 'hi' word certainty) Because Shankaracharya's siddhanta, though accepted as great acharya by people with asuri sampada, appears from experience and consideration of true shastras as self-conceived by own logic for deluding people, hence not dear to us. By obtaining that Parabrahman Shri Krishna, supreme welfare occurs. ॥18॥

**इतीति**  
When said thus by sadhus like Muktanand etc., the Lord Shri Hari, extremely pleased, again said to those sadhus – O munis! The Ramanujacharya mat which is dear to you, the same is dear to Me also. ॥19॥

**तस्येति**  
In this satsang today, all devotees are obtaining narAKRti Shri Krishna. From this manifest Shri Krishna, there is nothing more to know from shastras nor to obtain by many sadhanas. ॥20॥

**तथेति**  
Nevertheless, if a devotee has desire to see the divine amayik many riches endowed manifest Shri Krishna's Golok etc. main dhams (Golok, Akshar, Vaikunth etc.) and koti surya-like tejas etc., he can have that desire. ॥21॥

**इंदूशस्येति**  
In this satsang, does a devotee who does not desire to see such Bhagavad aishwarya have this firm conviction in heart or not that Hari who has come in narakrti is the lord of Akshardham? O saints! Give answer to My question. ॥22॥

**सन्त इति**  
At that very time, upon hearing Shri Hari's words, saints like Muktanand said – O Hare! Such a devotee who does not desire to see Your aishwarya does not have that conviction in heart, because that devotee desires to see something else from You, the sole refuge of all aishwaryas, manifest Shri Krishna Bhagavan. ॥23॥

**हरिरिति**  
When they answered thus, Hari said – O saints! What fault is there in such a devotee's desire to see Bhagavad aishwarya? No fault is seen, because that person desires to see the dham etc. of his own Ishtadev manifest Bhagavan only, not anything different from His relation. ॥24॥

**य इति**  
If one who is a servant of someone desires to see the glory of his own master, what harm in that? Rather, that desire to see glory is considered a virtue. ॥25॥

**इतीति**  
When asked thus by Shri Hari, the saints said – O Hare! You are all-knowing and knower of all shastra siddhantas, You give the answer to this question. Then Hari said to them. ॥26॥

**भक्तस्येति**  
The desire of a direct servant devotee of Shri Krishna to see Krishna dham etc. is proper, but he does not do it where it is proper to do, hence that desire becomes improper. ॥27॥

**साक्षादिति**  
Where manifest human-like formed Shri Krishna is residing on this earth, there itself His entire dham etc. glory is present. ॥28॥

**यदेत्ति**  
When for the welfare of people, with causeless boundless compassion, on this dust-world (earth) Shri Krishna Himself manifests, then with His own <mark1>dham (His own Aksharpad situated in the middle of Golok)</mark1> and with <mark1>parshads</mark1> etc. <mark1>parijans</mark1> He appears. ॥29॥

**स्वस्येति**  
Of the sole lord of fully powerful Aksharpad, manifest Shri Krishna's human-like form, dham appearing earthly (like earth), parshads appearing human-like – all this is His yogmaya which, though amayik, appears mayik and deludes people. ॥30॥

**नृत्वेति**  
There is no difference at all between human and divine forms of those manifest Shri Krishna etc., because people in samadhi, obtaining divine vision by Bhagavan's grace, see Him and dham-parshads only in divine amayik form – full-power endowed <mark1>Hari in divine form</mark1>, <mark1>earthly buildings etc. as Aksharpad form</mark1>, <mark1>parshads in brahmarupa</mark1> divine form. ॥31॥

**अत इति**  
Therefore, where Shri Krishna Himself is manifest, there itself all His <mark1>parshads</mark1>, <mark1>Radha-Rama etc. powers</mark1> and <mark1>Aksharpad etc. dhams</mark1> are present – understand this. ॥32॥

**तस्मा इति**  
To that narAKRti Bhagavan, food, clothes, wealth etc. offered by human devotees, He accepts with grace and affection for the benefit of devotees. ॥33॥

**तदिति**  
All that food etc. accepted by Bhagavan attains divinity. The offering human devotee, obtaining divine brahmamaya body, obtains that divinised food etc. in Shri Krishna's Akshardham. ॥34॥

**पीयूषेति**  
In this way, hearing Shri Hari's nectar-like piyushmaya speech, all devotees in the assembly, sadhus like Muktanand and householders, obtaining great satisfaction and joy, began respectfully bowing to Shri Hari going to His residence. ॥35॥

> **Concluding Shloka**  
> *The offence in the form of droha towards own devotee is unforgivable. The lord of Brahmapur (Akshardham) always having divine form. ॥1॥*  
> *The oneness of own narakar and divyakar – what Hari said with grace, may that make me His beloved. ॥2॥*
