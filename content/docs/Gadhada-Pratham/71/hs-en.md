## English Translation

In Vikram Samvat 1678, on the fourth day of the dark fortnight of the month of Chaitra, this Vachanamrut of Shri Hari manifested. **॥1॥**

In Gadhada, at Dadakhachar’s court, Shri Hari was seated upon an excellent platform on the dais near the western gate. **॥2॥**

Clad in pure white garments, surrounded by His devotees and householders, He remained seated while listening to devotional songs sung with reverence. **॥3॥**

Pleased upon hearing the discourse on the verses of Krishna, He addressed His devotees and said, “If anyone has any doubt, ask freely.” **॥4॥**

Then Somavarma bowed with folded hands and asked, “O Hari! How many kinds of offenses are committed by embodied beings?” **॥5॥**

“You are the ocean of compassion and, out of love for devotees, forgive all of them; yet is there any offense that You do not forgive?” **॥6॥**

When asked thus, Shri Hari, the true master of devotees, replied, “I forgive all offenses of My devotees, except enmity toward a devotee of God.” **॥7॥**

Therefore, one should never commit offense against a devotee of God; otherwise, one falls into the delusion of worldly existence. **॥8॥**

Among all offenses, denying the divine form of Krishna is a grave offense and should never be committed. **॥9॥**

In His Akshardham, the supreme abode radiant like millions of suns, Shri Krishna eternally resides as the divine form of Purushottam Bhagwan. **॥10॥**

Liberated souls serve Him in divine Brahmic form; and by that same grace, He manifests on earth in human form. **॥11॥**

Though His body appears material, it is not material; it is entirely divine—this should be firmly understood. **॥12॥**

The twenty-four elements and the three states of the body are seen in Krishna’s form, yet they remain eternal and unchanging. **॥13॥**

Thus explaining the doctrines of the formless and the with-form Brahman, the Lord turned toward the sadhus and posed a question. **॥14॥**

“O saints! I ask you something; listen and respond. Ramanuja and Shankara—both great acharyas—have spoken in the Shruti regarding Brahman.” **॥15॥**

Their doctrines are mutually opposed—one holds Brahman to be with form, the other formless. **॥16॥**

“Which doctrine is dear to your hearts?”—asked thus, the saints replied according to scripture. **॥17॥**

“That doctrine in which Brahman is described as Krishna, possessing form, is dear to us; for attaining that form brings supreme liberation.” **॥18॥**

Hearing this, the Lord was pleased and said, “What is dear to you is dear to Me as well.” **॥19॥**

Today, all devotees here are attaining Purushottam Bhagwan; therefore, nothing beyond this remains to be known or attained. Yet, if one desires to behold Golok and other supreme abodes along with His divine splendor, then—does such a devotee’s conviction regarding God remain pure or not? This is an extremely subtle question I pose. **॥20॥** **॥21॥** **॥22॥**

Then the saints said— “O Hari! This devotee’s conviction is not complete, because he desires to see something other than Krishna as well.” **॥23॥**

The Lord replied— “If a person desires to see Krishna’s dhams alone, what fault is there in that?” **॥24॥**

“The one who is your servant and desires to see only your splendor suffers no harm; indeed, he is considered virtuous.” **॥25॥**

Upon this, the all-knowing saints said— “Provide the proper answer,” and Hari further said— **॥26॥**

It is proper for a devotee to desire to see Krishna’s dhams, yet where it cannot be properly fulfilled, it is considered improper. **॥27॥**

Where Krishna manifests on earth in human form, there alone His dhams and entire splendor are revealed. **॥28॥**

When God descends for the welfare of humans, He comes along with His own dhams and family. **॥29॥**

The natural appearance of the dhams, being present on earth, and the attendants appearing as humans—all this is the enchanting maya of God. **॥30॥**

There is no difference between the mortal and divine forms; enlightened sadhus perceive Him in His divine form. **॥31॥**

Hence, wherever Krishna is present, there also His attendants, powers, and dhams are fully present—this should be understood. **॥32॥**

Food, clothing, and wealth offered to God are accepted by Him out of grace and love for the welfare of devotees. **॥33॥**

And all that becomes divine; the giver attains a divine body. **॥34॥**

Hearing such immortal words of God, the sadhus and household devotees present in the assembly experience supreme joy and offer obeisances to the great Lord. **॥35॥**
