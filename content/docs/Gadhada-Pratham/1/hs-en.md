title: "Vachanamrut Gadhada Pratham 1 – Constant Unbroken Fixation of the Mind on God's Form"
---

On the 4th day of the bright half of Margashirsha, Samvat 1876, Shriji Maharaj arrived in the evening at Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada, at the place where the sadhus were staying. At that time, Shriji Maharaj was dressed entirely in white clothes, and an assembly of sadhus along with haribhaktas from various places was seated before His divine face. **॥1॥** **॥2॥**

Then, being pleased, Shriji Maharaj Himself asked the sadhus, “Among all spiritual practices in this world, which one is the most difficult?” **॥3॥**

Upon being asked thus, the sadhus present in the assembly gave answers according to their understanding. Hearing them, Shriji Maharaj Himself replied, **॥4॥**

“Maintaining the mind's constant unbroken fixation (akhand vritti) on God's divine form – this is the most difficult of all spiritual practices.” **॥5॥**

“For one who has perfected this practice, there remains nothing greater to attain – this has been definitively stated by great rishis in the scriptures.” **॥6॥**

“The divine form of Paramatma upon which one meditates fulfils every wish of the devotee, just like a chintamani (wish-fulfilling gem).” **॥7॥**

“If desired, one can immediately behold the distinct forms of jiva, ishvara, brahma, and maya.” **॥8॥**

“One can also behold the divine abodes like Vaikuntha, etc., as per one's wish. Therefore, this practice is described as extremely difficult.” **॥9॥**

Hearing this question and answer, all the sadhus became extremely pleased. Thereafter, a devotee named Govardhan asked, **॥10॥**

“O Krishna! O Hari! I wish to know the nature of Your maya that is spoken of.” Upon saying this, Shri Hari replied to him, **॥11॥**

“Whatever obstructs the meditation of the meditator – that alone should be understood as maya, by which I, My devotees, and all humans become deluded.” **॥12॥**

Then Muktanand Swami asked, “O Lord! When a devotee of God leaves the gross body at the end and proceeds to Your supreme abode, what kind of body does he attain?” Hearing this, Shri Hari became extremely pleased and said, **॥13॥** **॥14॥**

“By Krishna's will alone, such devotees attain a divine, consciousness-made (chinmay) form and proceed to Golok dhama.” **॥15॥**

“There, some ride upon Garuda, some upon great chariots, and some upon divine vimanas – this is directly perceived by one in yogic samadhi.” **॥16॥**

Thereafter, a devotee named Harjivandas expressed his curiosity and asked, “O Lord! Please listen to my question and kindly answer it.” **॥17॥**

“Despite engaging in satsang for a long time, why does one not develop the same intense attachment towards satsang as one has towards one's own body and relatives?” Upon asking this, Shri Hari replied, **॥18॥**

“This person lacks complete knowledge of God's greatness (mahima).” **॥19॥**

“God's greatness is fully realised only through the association of saints. If liberation-seeking individuals have faith in the words of such saints, **॥20॥**

“then when those saints speak about their own nature (swabhav), the listener is unable to abandon that nature and instead perceives faults in the speaking saint. **॥21॥**

“Due to that sin, firm love for the saints does not develop in him. Sin committed in a holy pilgrimage site becomes indelible like vajra-lepa (diamond adhesive). **॥22॥**

“Sins committed elsewhere are destroyed through association with saints, but sins committed against saints are not destroyed without their grace.” **॥23॥**

“O dear devotee! Only when one does not perceive faults in saints does one attain generous-hearted love in satsang. Therefore, always accept only the virtues of saints and never their faults.” **॥24॥**

Hearing these words of Shri Hari, that devotee became extremely pleased with the nectar-like teaching, and all others also became joyful, bowed to the Lord, and imbibed that teaching in their hearts. **॥25॥**

## Thus ends the first tarang in Shri Harivakyasudhasindhu composed by Shatanand Muni. ॥1॥
