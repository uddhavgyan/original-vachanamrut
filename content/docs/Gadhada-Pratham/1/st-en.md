### Introduction to the Text

Here, the revered Shri Shatanand Muni has composed this text named **Shri Harivakya Sudha Sindhu** for the benefit of all Hari devotees, based on the Vachanamruts written by Muktanand and other munis.  
The explanation of its upodghat (preface) section has already been done earlier.

This text contains a total of **262** tarangs (chapters/Vachanamruts), distributed as follows:

- **Durgpur (Gadhada)**: 78 + 67 + 39 + 1 = **185**
- **Sarangpur**: 18
- **Kariyani**: 12
- **Loya**: 18
- **Panchala**: 7
- **Vartal**: 20
- **Ahmedabad**: 3

**Total**: 262 tarangs *<mark>(Note: In some traditions, a total of 273 Vachanamruts are counted, but originally there are 262.)</mark>*

Among these, the explanation of the 78 tarangs related to Durgpur (Gadhada) is being done first. Among them, the commentary on the **first tarang** is being presented first.

### Date and Context

In the Shaka year 1876 (corresponding to Vikram Samvat 1936, approximately 1879-80 CE), on the fourth tithi of the bright half of Margshirsh month, this Vachanamrut (discourse) of Shri Hari took place. (Remaining: abhavat – occurred.)

**तत्रेति**  
There — on that date in Durgpur (Gadhada), in the excellent king’s fort — as per Haim dictionary, ‘durg means fort and inaccessible place’. There also in the sadhus’ math (residence), in the assembly of His own devotees — among tyagi and grihastha devotees from various places — clad in white garments, Shri Hari Himself, after Vasudeva sandhya and aarti, came from His residence and sat on the prepared throne **॥2॥**

**अथेति**  
Thereafter, pleased on seeing the ekantik bhakti of sadhus, Shri Hari turned His moon-like face towards the sadhus (Muktanand Muni and others) and said:  
“O Sadhus! Among all sadhans in this world — for God’s pleasure through swadharma, tapa etc. — which sadhan is the most difficult? Tell me.” **॥3॥**

**इतीति**  
When asked thus, the sadhus in the assembly answered according to their understanding. But their answers were not fully accurate. Knowing this, Shri Hari, who is capable of giving true answers, spoke Himself **॥4॥**

This was said in five shlokas —  
**अखण्डमिति**  
“O Sadhus! Fixing the mind in God’s murti — in waking, dream, and deep sleep states — unbroken like a stream of oil and continuous like a flame in a windless place — this is the sadhan that, in My opinion, is extremely difficult compared to all others.” **॥5॥**

**येनेति**  
“The devotee who, through knowledge of God’s supreme greatness, has perfected this sadhan — for him, no other superior sadhan remains for attaining God’s pleasure. This has been definitively stated by great rishis in the shastras.  
As Vyasji says in the Mahabharata:  
> ‘After examining all shastras and reflecting repeatedly, the single conclusion is that Narayana should always be meditated upon.’ (Mahabharata, Anushasan Parva 124-10)” **॥6॥**

**यदिति**  
“The devotee who has continuously contemplated <mark1>Shri Krishna</mark1>’s murti in his mind — that murti fulfils all his desired objects certainly, like a chintamani.” **॥7॥**

This is further said in half a shloka —  
**जीवेति**  
“If such a devotee wishes to see separately the forms of jiva, kshetrajna (knower of the body), ishwar, virat, brahm (abode), aksharbrahm with its divine attributes, akshar-purush (lord of mul-prakruti), maya, mul-prakruti, etc., he sees them immediately in reality.” **॥8॥**

**वैकुण्ठेति**  
“Such a devotee directly sees his desired Vaikunth and other abodes (**आदिशब्दादोलोकाक्षरब्रह्मश्वेतद्वीपादीनां ग्रहणम्** — including aksharbrahm, shwetdweep etc.). Therefore, this previously mentioned sadhan is described as supremely excellent and extremely difficult among all sadhans.” **॥9॥**

**इतीति**  
Hearing this question-answer, Muktanand and all sadhus became extremely pleased. Thereafter, the excellent merchant devotee Govardhan (resident of Makaralaypur, ekantik servant) asked Shri Hari **॥10॥**

**ज्ञातं यथार्थतया...**  
“I wish to know accurately” — when asked thus by Govardhan devotee, Shri Hari said —  
“O Krishna! O Lord! O Hari! What is the nature of the maya You have mentioned?” **॥11॥**

**यदिति**  
“O devotee! Whatever — body, field, wife, son, wealth etc. — creates obstacles in the unbroken contemplation of God’s murti, that is maya. It is the maya that causes the feelings of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ in people.  
Due to ego and possessiveness born of maya, attachment arises in body etc., preventing unbroken meditation on God.  
As said in Srimad Bhagavat:  
> *‘O Lord! Due to Your maya, we place ego-possessiveness in this lowly body and fall from Adhokshaja (God).’ (Bhag. 5-19-15)*” **॥12॥**

**इतीति**  
Hearing this answer, Govardhan devotee became extremely pleased. Thereafter, the foremost among sadhus, Muktanand Muni, asked another question **॥13॥**

**प्रभो इति**  
“O Lord! How do Your ekantik devotees in this world, at the end (when prarabdha karma ends), leave this gross material body (including subtle and causal bodies) and attain Your supreme abode (**पद गोलोकान्तर्वर्त्यक्षरधाम** - <mark1>Akshardham situated in Golok</mark1>)?” **॥14॥**

**तमिति**  
Hearing this, Shri Harikrishna Bhagavan told Muktanand Muni —  
“O Muni! Those devotees, after leaving the material body etc., by <mark1>Shri Krishna’s will</mark1> alone obtain a divine, chinmay, brahmamay, non-material body and reach <mark1>Akshardham situated in Golok</mark1>.  
As shruti says: *‘On destruction of gunas, one attains brahma-body.’*” **॥15॥**

**तत्रेति**  
“Among those devotees, some go to God’s abode riding Garuda, some on golden chariot, some on divine vimana. All this is directly seen by a samadhi-sth devotee who has obtained divine vision by God’s grace.” **॥16॥**

**अथेति**  
Thereafter, the excellent devotee Harji asked Shri Hari —  
“O Lord! Please grace me by answering my question.” **॥17॥**

**बह्विति**  
“O Hari! Even after doing <mark1>satsang (association with Shri Krishna, sadhu, dharma, and shastra — these four)</mark1> for a long time, why does deep attachment remain in body, field, wife, son, wealth etc., but similar deep love does not arise in <mark1>Shri Krishna</mark1> and the other three? What is the reason?” **॥18॥**

**अत्रेति**  
When asked thus by Harji devotee, Shri Hari said —  
“O devotee! Such a person lacks true knowledge of God’s greatness. That is why deep love does not arise in <mark1>Shri Krishna</mark1> and the other three.” **॥19॥**

... (The means for knowledge of greatness is association with sincere sadhus — stated further)

**दोषमिति**  
“O Harji devotee! When this person does not see faults in sadhus, only then does great love — accompanied by knowledge of greatness with liberal heart — arise in him towards <mark1>Shri Krishna</mark1> and the other three. Therefore, one should always grasp only the virtues of sadhus and never see their faults.” **॥24॥**

**श्रुत्वेति**  
Hearing this nectar-like words of Shri Hari, Harji devotee became extremely pleased. All tyagi and grihastha devotees seated in the assembly also became joyful. Everyone bowed to Shri Hari and retained His teachings in their hearts **॥25॥**

>*I worship that Shri Hari who, through questions-answers, gives happiness to His dependents and takes them to His own Brahmapur (Akshardham).* **॥1॥**
