### Tarang 218 - Vartal 18

---

In the Vikram Samvat year 1882, on the Shukla Pratipada of Magh month, this ambrosial discourse of Lord Hari manifested. **॥1॥**

At that time, in the town named Vrittalayapur, in the temple of Lakshmi-Narayan, after the evening nirajan (sandhya aarti), Lord Hari was seated on the eternal throne. **॥2॥**

Wearing white garments, surrounded on all sides by various devotees, Lord Hari said to the great sadhus—“There is one question, listen to it.” **॥3॥**

“After asking what must the people dwelling in satsang necessarily know in a simple way?” the Lord Himself gave the answer to that. **॥4॥**

Satsangi persons should properly understand four subjects— <mark1>sampradaya, desired scriptures, duties of householders, and ishta-deva</mark1>. **॥5॥**

The first among them is sampradaya, which is the tradition of one's own gurus. In it, <mark1>the original guru is Uddhava</mark1>, because he propagated this path. **॥6॥**

He is to be known as <mark1>Uddhava in the form of Ramanand Swami</mark1>, to whom the guru-pad was offered by Shri Krishna Himself. His guru is to be known as <mark1>directly Swami Ramanuj</mark1>. **॥7॥**

In the great kshetra named Shrirang, there is his samadhi. Thereafter, he received Vaishnava diksha, and I became his disciple. **॥8॥**

In my Ayodhya Prasad, accepting Raghuvir as son, <mark>the guru-ship is established in Dharmavanshi – this is the guru-order</mark>. **॥9॥**

In the Uddhava path, there are <mark1>eight desired scriptures</mark1>— <mark1>Vedas, Vyasa-sutras, Shrimad Bhagavatam</mark1> etc. **॥10॥**

The <mark1>Vishnu Sahasranama Stotra spoken by the Lord, Bhagavad Gita, Vidura-niti, and Mahabharata</mark1>—these three are also included. **॥11॥**

<mark1>Shri Vasudeva Mahatmya (from Skanda Purana) and Yajnavalkya Smriti</mark1>—these scriptures are also counted as Agama. **॥12॥**

The duties of renunciates and householders are different— all of them should be known completely from Shri Vasudeva Mahatmya. **॥13॥**

<mark1>The ishta-deva is Lord Shri Krishna, who is the husband of Radhika ji</mark1>. His form is to be known in both <mark1>pratyaksha</mark1> and <mark1>paroksha</mark1> ways. **॥14॥**

<mark>In paroksha form, He is in Goloka in the middle of Brahm-dham, always in two-armed form, adorned by Radha and Lakshmi, radiant like crores of suns.</mark> **॥15॥**

Served by chief attendants like Shridama, Nand etc., that Shri Krishna is the creator, sustainer, and destroyer of infinite crores of universes. **॥16॥**

Four-armed, eight-armed, and thousand-armed—such various forms He assumes in different dhams. **॥17॥**

In forms beginning with Vasudeva, He becomes Chaturvyuha, and in forms like Keshav etc., He manifests twenty-four kinds of forms. **॥18॥**

In the same way, He assumes avatars like Varaha etc. on earth; and in each, there is special purport. **॥19॥**

<mark>This paroksha form is the essential (unmanifest, divine) form of Shri Krishna; whereas the pratyaksha form exists on earth in human shape.</mark> **॥20॥**

All the divine acts in the human form of the Lord are worthy to be heard, because Vyasa-deva has described them with utmost devotion. **॥21॥**

<mark1>Among all acharyas, Vyasadeva is considered the greatest, because his words are self-evident pramana like the Vedas.</mark1> **॥22॥**

Shankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Nimbarka, and Vishnuswami etc. were great acharyas of true dharma on earth. **॥23॥**

They all accepted Vyas's words as pramana; therefore, those words are our primary pramana. **॥24॥**

Vyasadeva first composed the four kinds of Vedas for the welfare of humanity, thereafter Brahman etc. Puranas and Mahabharata. **॥25॥**

But realizing that the means for ultimate liberation was not clearly stated, out of compassion, he composed Shrimad Bhagavatam. **॥26॥**

Having extracted the essence of all Vedas, scriptures, Puranas, and Pancharatra, this scripture was composed in the form of rasa. **॥27॥**

In it, <mark1>the supporter of all avatars is Shri Krishna Himself, the supreme Lord, and He is the source of avatars as well as eternally nirguna</mark1>—this is stated. **॥28॥**

Shri Krishna Himself clearly stated His nirguna nature to Uddhava in the Gunadhyaya of the Eleventh Skandha. **॥29॥**

By relation with whom even guna-based bhavas become nirguna—that Shri Krishna possessing such relation is Himself nirguna. **॥30॥**

Whoever attained relation with the Lord through any bhav like kama, dwesh, bhaya etc., they also attained nirguna state. **॥31॥**

<mark>If the Lord were not nirguna, He would be pure sattva-form; then how would the gopis etc. become nirguna by relation with Him?</mark> **॥32॥**

<mark1>Therefore, Shri Krishna is nirguna only—there is no doubt in this.</mark1> He Himself says that His birth and actions are divine. **॥33॥**

“My birth and actions are divine”—one who knows this in essence, after leaving the body, does not take rebirth, but attains Me. **॥34॥**

Shri Krishna, by His own will, showed various effulgent forms even to some non-devotees. **॥35॥**

Sometimes four-armed, sometimes eight-armed, sometimes thousand-armed form—He manifests according to necessity. **॥36॥**

Due to the difference in these three kinds of forms, difference in upasana is scriptural and logical. **॥37॥**

<mark>Even of the same two-armed form, some consider separate upasana due to difference in place, state, and attire.</mark> **॥38॥**

<mark>But this view is not ours; therefore, seekers of liberation should not accept it,</mark> and should not imitate the Lord's conduct either. **॥39॥**

The Lord's teachings manifest svadharma, jnana, vairagya, and bhakti, and truly reveal the greatness of His own devotees. **॥40॥**

The words spoken by the Lord to Uddhava, to Arjuna, and to other devotees are for the welfare of the world. **॥41॥**

These words should always be respectfully accepted by devotees; but one should not imitate the Lord's conduct by seeing it. **॥42॥**

If someone, seeing the pastimes, sports etc. with the gopis, acts accordingly, **॥43॥**

then he falls from sadachara and certainly goes to hell; therefore, my dependent persons should never do such things. **॥44॥**

Just as some conduct of Shri Krishna is unscriptural and blameworthy by the world and thus not acceptable, similarly, one should never accept such conduct of one's own guru. **॥45॥**

The words explaining the dharma of renunciates and householders, from the Uddhava path, must be observed by my dependents. **॥46॥**

<mark>Whoever does not act accordingly is never mine; this fact should be held in everyone's heart.</mark> **॥47॥**

The groups of renunciates and householders drank these words born from dharma-anga as if nectar, and all carefully held them in the lotus of their heart. **॥48॥**

The devotees properly knew that same Shri Krishna in their heart as their Lord and guru, worshipped Him with exclusive supreme bhakti, and held firm conviction in His lordship. **॥49॥**
