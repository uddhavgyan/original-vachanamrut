### Tarang 197 - Gadhada Madhya 64

---

In **Vikram Samvat 1881**, on the **seventh lunar day (Saptami) of the bright fortnight of the Sahasya (Mārgaśīrṣa) month**, these *Vachanāmṛta*—the divine words of Lord Hari—were revealed. **॥1॥**

At that time, in the city named **Durgapura**, in the 'durg' of renowned ruler named **Uttama** He was seated upon a raised seat (āsana) placed on the altar within the temple of Lord Vāsudeva. **॥2॥**

He was adorned in pure white garments and was surrounded on all sides by assemblies of devotees of various kinds. At that moment, **Svayamprakāśānanda**, facing towards the northern direction, posed a question to him. **॥3॥**

He said—  
“O Lord! The incarnations of Lord Hari are innumerable. Is there any hierarchy or distinction among those incarnations, or are they all equal?” **॥4॥**

**Śrī Hari spoke—**

All the scriptures composed by Me and by Sage Vedavyāsa are fully authoritative and well-established in accordance with *Śruti* and *Smṛti*. Their meanings also become firmly ascertained when examined in the light of their contextual sequence (prior and subsequent passages). **॥5॥**

TAll the incarnations of Kṛṣṇa—such as Matsya and Kūrma—have manifested according to their respective ordained purposes; however, <mark1>Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself is the Supreme Lord in person</mark1>. **॥6॥**

Therefore, it is firmly concluded that **Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the source-incarnator (Avatārī)**, while all others are His incarnations. He alone is our chosen deity, and He alone abides within the hearts of those who walk the path of Uddhava—that is, the path of devotion. **॥7॥**

Though supremely powerful, He appears gentle; though associated with desire, He upholds perfect celibacy; though a heroic warrior, He is exceedingly compassionate—thus, His divine sovereignty is truly wondrous and astonishing. **॥8॥**

In the **Tenth Canto of the Śrīmad Bhāgavata Purāṇa**, Sage Vyāsa has described all of His divine exploits in full detail, right from the beginning. **॥9॥**

Hence, that Tenth Canto alone stands as a special and supreme authority for us, because it expounds the science of devotion and narrates the supreme glory of the chosen Lord. **॥10॥**

Wherever the incarnations of Śrī Kṛṣṇa are described in their true philosophical essence, all such scriptures are, in a general sense, acceptable and authoritative for Me. **॥11॥**

Thereafter, a learned brāhmaṇa named **Puruṣottama** bowed respectfully to the Supreme Lord. Standing in the assembly with folded hands, he humbly and joyfully asked a question. **॥12॥**

“O Lord! O Śrī Kṛṣṇa Bhagavān! How do You abide in Your supreme Akṣara-dhāma? And what is Your form and mode of existence within these innumerable universes?” **॥13॥**

**Śrī Hari spoke—**

In **Brahma-dhāma**, Lord Hari Himself resides directly upon a divine throne. Multitudes of liberated souls continuously serve Him through divine and manifold modes of worship. **॥14॥**

He is the Lord even of all lords and shines forth like the emperor of emperors. The rulers of countless universes worship His sacred feet. **॥15॥**

All those deities function under His command, yet with complete autonomy—just as provincial kings govern independently while remaining under the sovereignty of a supreme emperor. **॥16॥**

Though established there, the Lord pervades all universes through His own powers—just as the sun, stationed in the sky, illuminates all regions by its rays. **॥17॥**

Though one, He manifests—according to purpose and by His mere will—freely and independently, appearing through His incarnations within innumerable cosmic eggs (universes). **॥18॥**

Endowed with infinite sovereignty and being the master of infinite powers, He creates thousands of universes solely through His own divine energy. **॥19॥**

In some places they are in the hundreds, elsewhere in the millions or billions, and in some cases only a single universe—thus, He Himself also brings about their dissolution. **॥20॥**

At the time of cosmic dissolution, He reduces this earth to the atomic state; and at the time of creation, He again expands it to vast proportions. **॥21॥**

At times He manifests clouds in the sky, and at other times, by His own power, He dissolves them. **॥22॥**

Thus, the Lord Hari abides endowed with inconceivable majesty. That very same Supreme Being descends upon the earth under the name **Kṛṣṇa**, in proximity to material nature. **॥23॥**

Having firmly realized that He is the one and only Lord—complete in all divine attributes and alone worthy of service—the brāhmaṇa, after imbibing the nectar of His words, experienced supreme bliss along with Him and all present. **॥24॥**

### Thus concludes the one hundred and ninety-seventh (197th) *Taraṅga* of the *Śrī Harivākya-Sudhāsindhu*, composed by Śatānanda.
