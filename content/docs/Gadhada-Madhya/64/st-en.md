### Tarang 197 - Gadhada Madhya 64's commentary

---
> **Introductory Verse**\
> ***<mark>सर्वेभ्योऽन्यावतारेभ्यः कृष्णस्याधिकता स्फुटम् । चतुःषष्टितमे प्रोक्ता दिव्यैश्वर्योंक्तिपूर्विका ॥१॥</mark>***\
> <mark>This verse clearly states Krishna's superiority over all other avatars. It was mentioned in the 64th tarang before the description of divine glories.</mark> **॥१॥**

**शकेति ।**  
The explanation of the first half has already been given. (1881) This refers to Vikram Samvat 1881. On the seventh day of the bright half related to the thousand, which is the seventh of Paush Shukla, this nectar-like speech of Hari was revealed. **॥१॥**

**तत्रेति ।**  
On that date, in the town of Durgpur, the king famous as Uttam, in a fort-like strong place, seated Śrīhari on a platform with a sheet-covered bed in the outer courtyard of Vāsudeva's temple, or Śrīhari sat there. **॥२॥**

**सितेति ।**  
Wearing all white clothes, Śrīhari was surrounded by various groups of devotees from different countries—renunciates, householders, and dependents. In the great assembly, they were fully encircled. Facing north, the seated Śrīhari was questioned by the sage Svayaṃprakāśānanda. **॥३॥**

**अवतारा इति ।**  
O Lord! Your avatars—who bear all avatars and reside in Akṣaradhām under the name Krishna, distinct from Hari—are countless thousands. Is there hierarchy (degrees of superiority) among those avatars, or are they all equal? **॥४॥**

> ***स्वयंप्रकाशान्देन सतेत्थं पुरुषोत्तमः । स सम्पृष्टोऽब्रवीत्तं च सुखयन्त्रपरानिति ॥ अनादिश्रीकृष्णनामा स्वयं श्रीहरिरव सः । सर्वावतारधर्तारं तं स्वमाह परोक्षतः***

This verse states that when asked thus by Svayaṃprakāśānanda, Puruṣottama (Śrīhari) replied, delighting him and others. The eternal Śrīkṛṣṇa-named Śrīhari Himself indirectly referred to Himself as the bearer of all avatars.

**मयेति ।**  
O sage! All scriptures composed by Vyāsa have been heard by me. Through sequential consideration, their meaning as stated by Vyāsa is determined. **॥५॥**

**तत्रेति ।**  
In those scriptures, all avatars like Matsya, Kūrma etc., manifested according to need, belong to Krishna—this is the remainder. But Krishna Himself is the Lord bearing all avatars—this should be added. Accordingly, it is said in Śrīmad Bhāgavata:  
> <mark>*एते चांशकलाः पुंसः कृष्णस्तु भगवान् स्वयम् । इन्द्राव्याकुलं लोकं मृडयन्ति युगे युगे (Bhā. 1-3-28)*</mark> \
> *All these incarnations are either plenary portions (aṁśa) or portions of plenary portions (kalā) of the Supreme Person (Puṁsaḥ), but Lord Kṛṣṇa is the original Bhagavān Himself.
They appear in every age to give relief (or delight) to the world distressed by the enemies of Indra (the demons).*
**॥६॥**

**अत इति ।**  
Thus ends. Therefore, for this reason. <mark1>Krishna is the Avatārī (source of all avatars), the origin of all avatars. The others are avatars.</mark1> Thus, this is the firm conclusion. Since avatars manifest according to their specific purposes, and due to the gradation in divine powers (aiśvarya-tāratamya), there is gradation among them. <mark>But in the Avatārī Krishna, because He is the cause of those avatars and is endowed with all divine attributes and powers, there is no such gradation</mark>—this is the intent of the question and answer.
<mark>That Shri Krishna is our Ishtadev (chosen deity) and Upāsya Dev (worshipable deity) for those who follow the path of Uddhava. Indeed. Since the followers of Uddhava have Shri Krishna as their Ishtadev, and because He is My own form, I Myself am their Ishtadev—this is the profound hidden meaning.</mark> **॥७॥**

**बलिष्ठ इति ।**  
That Śrīkṛṣṇa, though supremely strong, shows fear by fleeing etc. Though displaying desire through carrying loads on gopīs' shoulders etc., He is a strict celibate (Krishna's celibacy is to be understood from Gopālatāpanī Upaniṣad). Though heroic, by slaying lakhs of demons and kings in battle and granting them liberation, He shows supreme compassion. Thus, Śrīkṛṣṇa's glory is wondrous in many ways. **॥८॥**

**श्रीमदिति ।**  
In the tenth skandha of Śrīmad Bhāgavata Purāṇa, all characters of Śrīkṛṣṇa from the beginning are described by Vyāsa. **॥९॥**

**अत इति ।**  
Therefore, that tenth skandha is our special authority. Due to the description of the greatness of our worshipped Śrīkṛṣṇa there, it is accepted as a scripture of devotion. Devotion arises there only from understanding its greatness—this is the sentiment. **॥१०॥**

**यत्रेति ।**  
Scriptures where Krishna and His avatars are described truthfully are generally accepted by me. **॥११॥**

**अथेति ।**  
After hearing such words of Śrīhari, the learned brāhmaṇa Puruṣottama named Bhaṭṭāvaṭaṅka from Nandigrāma, seated in the assembly for darśana, with folded hands and free from pride of knowledge, bowed to the manifest Supreme Lord Śrīhari and asked. **॥१२॥**

**श्रीकृष्ण इति ।**  
O Lord! The all-glorious Śrīkṛṣṇa—how do You reside in Your supreme, illusion-transcending Akṣaradhāma, and how in the universes? **॥१३॥**

> ***पुरुषोत्तमभट्टेन श्रीकृष्णः पृष्ट इत्यसौ । नन्दयंस्तं द्विजं चान्यानूचे त्वित्थं परात्परः । ब्रह्मेति ।***

O brāhmaṇa! In Akṣaradhāma, Hari directly resides on a beautiful throne, served by countless liberated souls with divine offerings. **॥१४॥**

**सर्वेति ।**  
The Lord of all lords, that Śrīhari, has His feet worshipped by numerous universe-lords and resides like an emperor. **॥१५॥**

**वर्तत इति ।**  
Just as regional kings remain in fear under the emperor's command, so do those numerous universe-lords remain in fear under Śrīhari's command, never independently. **॥१६॥**

**व्याप्नोतीति ।**  
Seated in His Akṣaradhāma, that Śrīhari pervades the universes with His inner-controller powers—like the sun in the sky pervades all regions with its rays. That is, He remains to maintain each being's form, existence, and activity, granting appropriate fruit of actions. **॥१७॥**

**एक इति ।**  
Though independent and one, by will alone He manifests in universes through avatars like Varāha and through infusion of His glories and qualities in many forms. **॥१८॥**

**अनन्तेति ।**  
Endowed with infinite glories and lord of infinite powers, that Śrīhari creates thousands of universes somewhere with His power. **॥१९॥**

**लक्षश इति ।**  
Somewhere lakhs, crores, hundreds of universes, or just one. In this way, He also effects their dissolution and maintenance. **॥२०॥**

**स इति ।**  
That Śrīhari reduces this earth to atomic form at dissolution and expands it greatly at creation. **॥२१॥**

**सविद्युत इति ।**  
That Śrīhari sometimes manifests lightning-accompanied clouds in the sky with His power and sometimes hides them. **॥२२॥**

**अचिन्त्येति ।**  
Thus, the Lord Hari with inconceivable majesty resides. That very Śrīhari resides on earth near the material world as Krishna. **॥२३॥**

**पूर्ण इति ।**  
Complete in all arts, this Śrīhari alone is your object of service and worship—know this. Drinking this nectar-speech of Śrīhari, that brāhmaṇa named Puruṣottama rejoiced with His dependent renunciates and householders. **॥२४॥**

### Concluding Verse

> ***सर्वावतारधारित्वं सर्वकारणतात्मनः । येनोक्ता श्रीहरिः सोऽस्तु सदैव मम मानसे ॥१॥***\
> *May that Śrīhari—who described the bearer of all avatars and the cause of all—ever reside in my mind. **॥१॥***
