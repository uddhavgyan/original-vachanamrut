### Purpose of Shri Hari’s Incarnation – The Curse Received by the Sages at Badrikashram

Shri Hari is said in the scriptures to have manifested in His own intrinsic, divine form.
I shall now briefly describe, at the outset, His incarnation (birth) and deeds. **॥28॥**

Once, the great sages <mark1>Marichi and others</mark1> went to <mark1>Badrivana</mark1> for the दर्शन of <mark1>Nara–Narayana</mark1> Bhagavan. **॥29॥**

After beholding Him and offering worship, the sages sat near Him; then the Lord, who acts for the welfare of austerity, asked them about the well-being of mankind. **॥30॥**

They replied that demonic disturbances were arising on the earth; at that very moment <mark1>Dharma arrived along with his consort Murti</mark1>. **॥31॥**

Seeing them, Bhagavan (together with Uddhava) was seated there; He honored His <mark1>father</mark1> and seated him upon an appropriate seat. **॥32॥**

The sages then narrated what they had spoken; Bhagavan listened to it attentively, and those Brahman sages remained calm and undisturbed. **॥33॥**

While all of them, with one-pointed minds, were listening to these words, <mark1>Sage Durvasa arrived from Mount Kailasa</mark1>, desiring to see them. **॥34॥**

Fixing their gaze upon the divine face of the Lord and drinking the nectar of His words, they appeared as though absorbed in samadhi; thus they did not notice the one who had arrived. **॥35॥**

<mark1>Narayana</mark1> too, being deeply absorbed in the discourse, did not see him; thereupon the sage considered himself disrespected. **॥36॥**

Overpowered by the fire of anger arising from wounded pride, the sage raised his arm and forefinger and pronounced a curse upon them all. **॥37॥**

Since you did not offer me due honor here, you shall soon experience demonic suffering while living in human form. **॥38॥**

Hearing this, all became suddenly distressed; immediately Dharma rose, bowed to the sage, and began to seek forgiveness. **॥39॥**

O great sage! We did not knowingly insult you. You are worthy of honor; therefore, please bestow your grace upon us. **॥40॥**

Thus, when earnestly prayed to by Dharma with humility, the Brahmana, granting grace, said — O Dharma, listen to my words. **॥41॥**

Though this curse has been uttered by me out of ignorance, it shall not prove otherwise; yet this <mark1>Narayana</mark1> Himself will free you all from it. **॥42॥**

He shall incarnate on earth as the <mark1>son of Dharma and Murti</mark1>, and as a youthful sage, will surely protect you from the demons. **॥43॥**

Having said this, the sage bowed to the Lord and departed again for the White Mountain; then Bhagavan spoke to Dharma, who was fearful because of the curse. **॥44॥**

Though I am the Lord capable of nullifying this faultless curse, I accept it willingly for a divine purpose. **॥45॥**

In this age, unrighteousness and the demons shall gain strength through Kali and increase; their destruction is now My intent. **॥46॥**

For I shall become your son, destroy them, and undoubtedly protect all of you who take human birth. **॥47॥**

Therefore, all of you freely incarnate among human beings on earth without fear. Thus instructed by the Lord, Dharma and the others bowed to Him and accepted birth among mankind. **॥48॥**
