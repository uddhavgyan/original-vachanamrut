**आत्मीयेनैव रूपेण जज्ञे हरिरिति श्रुतः।**  
It is described in the scriptures that Hari took birth in His own divine form. He is the ocean of beauty that vanquishes the pride of countless Cupids, resides in Akshardham, is eternal, and is known by the name Hari. He manifested through bhakti and dharma – this is the combined meaning of the three verses. I shall first briefly describe the birth and deeds of that Sri Hari – meaning His manner of appearance and pastimes ॥**28॥**

**तत्रादौ सनिमित्तं श्रीहरिप्रादुर्भावप्रकारमाह।**  
First, it describes the reason and manner of Sri Hari’s appearance. From “maharsayah” up to the context ending with “ananda alone prevailed everywhere on earth at that time”. Once, sages like Marichi went to Badarikashrama for the devoted darshan of Nar-Narayan Bhagavan – that is, to have darshan that makes human birth successful, the fruit of pilgrimage in Bharatvarsha ॥**29॥**

**दृष्ट्वार्चयित्वा विभं ते निषेदुस्तदन्तिके।**  
Those great sages saw the all-pervading Sri Narayana, who is capable of removing the infinite sorrows of His dependents, worshipped Him with available articles, and sat near Him by Sri Narayana’s command. The Lord Sri Narayana, whose penance benefits His dependents, inquired from those great sages about the welfare of the people living in Bharatvarsha who are His dependents ॥**30॥**

**प्रोचुस्ते जायमानं तमसुरोपद्रवं भुवि।**  
Those great sages questioned by Sri Narayana told Him about the torment of their dependent people caused by kings with asura traits arising on the land of Bharatvarsha. At that very moment, Dharma himself, the Prajapati, arrived there near Sri Narayana along with his wife named Murti for darshan ॥**31॥**

**तं दृष्ट्वा सोद्धवस्तत्र निषण्णो भगवानपि।**  
There, Lord Sri Narayana, seated on the central seat in the assembly of sages along with Uddhava, saw His father (creator) Dharma who had come for His darshan, honored him appropriately, and seated him on a suitable seat ॥**32॥**

**उवाच च मुनिप्रोक्तं तस्मै तवृत्तमप्यसौ।**  
Sri Narayana told Dharma in detail the incident of torment by asuras upon the devotees living in Bharatvarsha that the sages like Marichi had first told Him. Dharma listened with respect to that account spoken by Sri Narayana (from “ca” it should be connected that Uddhava also listened). The brahmin sages like Marichi seated in front of Sri Narayana also listened undisturbed and with respect. The reason for listening even to one’s own words with respect is the extraordinary wonder created by the mixture of nectar-like words coming from the supreme Lord Sri Narayana’s lotus mouth itself – this is the sentiment ॥**33॥**

**एवमेकाग्रचित्तेषु तेषु शृण्वत्सु तद्वचः।**  
In this way, while bhakti, dharma, Uddhava, and sages like Marichi were listening with one-pointed undisturbed mind to Sri Narayana’s nectar-like words, sage Durvasa came from Kailasa mountain desiring to see Sri Narayana and stood behind the sage assembly facing Sri Narayana ॥**34॥**

**भगवन्मुखदत्ताक्षाः पिबन्तस्तद्वचोमृतम्।**  
Sages like Marichi along with dharma etc., who had fixed their eyes on Sri Narayana’s lotus mouth like the chakora bird on the moon, were drinking with great reverence the nectar of Sri Narayana’s words and, as if in deep samadhi, did not see the sage Durvasa who had come by the inner inspiration of Sri Narayana’s will ॥**35॥**

**नारायणोऽपि नापश्यत् तं वार्तासक्तमानसः।**  
Even Lord Sri Narayana Himself, with mind absorbed in conversation, did not see the arrived Durvasa. At that time, the great sage Durvasa considered himself insulted by them ॥**36॥**

**मानभङ्गसमुद्भूतकोधाग्निविवशोऽथ तान्।**  
Then, overpowered by the fire of anger born from the breaking of his pride of being universally worshipful, sage Durvasa raised his right arm high with the index finger pointed and cursed them all ॥**37॥**

**न सन्मानः कृतो यस्माद्भवद्भिरिह मे ततः।**  
Because you all, including Narayana, did not give me proper respect here in this place conducive to dharma – rising, offering padya-arghya etc. as per etiquette – therefore all of you will soon suffer torment in human birth and from kings born of asura parts – scolding, beating etc. Even though divine, your improper attainment of human body and there torment by kings with daitya traits – both these will happen by my curse – this is the meaning ॥**38॥**

**तच्छ्रुत्वा सहसा सर्वे बभूवुर्व्यग्रचेतसः।**  
Hearing that thunderbolt-like angry words of Durvasa, all including dharma and Uddhava suddenly became anxious-minded and disturbed at heart. Then dharma immediately stood up, offered obeisance to Durvasa with eight-limbed prostration, and began pleading forgiveness with gentle words and consoling him ॥**39॥**

**नापमानः कृतोऽस्माभिर्महर्षे बुद्धिपूर्वकम्।**  
O great sage! We did not intentionally insult you who are always worthy of respect, but due to one-pointed mind in listening to Narayana’s words, your arrival went unnoticed – this is the meaning. Therefore, you are fit to show grace by removing the curse ॥**40॥**

**एवं सम्प्रार्थितो विप्रो धर्मेण विनयेन सः।**  
Thus humbly prayed by dharma with folded hands, the extremely pride-craving brahmin Durvasa showed grace and said – O dharma! Listen to my words ॥**41॥**

**अज्ञानजोऽपि मे शापो नान्यथा भविता क्वचित्।**  
My curse, though born of ignorance of your non-arrival, will never become false. But this Narayana, who is beyond the reach of you three, will certainly deliver you from my curse ॥**42॥**

**मनुष्यभूतयोः पुत्रो दम्पत्योर्वामसौ भुवि।**  
This Sri Narayana, becoming the son of you both couple who have attained human form on earth, will definitely protect you both and these sages (and from “ca” Uddhava also) from asuras ॥**43॥**

**इत्युक्त्वा स प्रभुं नत्वा पुनः श्वेताचलं ययौ।**  
Saying thus, sage Durvasa bowed to the Lord Sri Narayana and again went to Kailasa mountain. Then Lord Sri Narayana spoke to dharma who was extremely frightened by the sudden curse ॥**44॥**

**निष्कारणमिमं शापं निवारयितुमीश्वरः।**  
O father! Though I am the Lord fully capable of nullifying this causeless curse, yet I accept this curse by My own will for a certain reason to be stated ॥**45॥**

**अधर्मश्चासुरा अस्मिन् वर्षे प्राप्य बलं कलेः।**  
In this Bharatkhanda, adharma and asuras have gained strength from Kali and increased. Now at this time, I desire their complete destruction ॥**46॥**

**यतोऽहं त्वत्सुतो भूत्वा तदुच्छेदं समाचरन्।**  
For this reason, becoming your son in human form, I shall thoroughly destroy adharma and asuras and protect all of you who have become human from calamities caused by asura gurus and kings – no doubt ॥**47॥**

**अतो यथेष्टं भुवि मानुषेषु सर्वेऽपि यूयं भवतापशङ्कम्।**  
Therefore, all of you fearlessly take birth as desired among the three-varna humans on earth. Thus addressed by Lord Sri Narayana, dharma and others bowed to Him and took birth among the three-varna people in Bharatvarsha. Here, from sages like Marichi to “as desired”, the intent of the context is that the appearance of Sri Hari, who will manifest through bhakti and dharma of the lord of Srimad Brahmapur Sri Swaminarayan, is described in that form accepting non-difference due to similar conduct with His own avatara Narayana Rishi possessing qualities like beloved steadfast celibate-like attire, penance, detached dharma, steadfast celibacy vow, forgiveness, compassion etc. Otherwise, starting from Sri Goloka here itself “Hari took birth in His own form” as stated in the earlier text
