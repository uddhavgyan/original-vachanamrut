Victory to Shri Hari! The son of Dharma, who assumed human form for the welfare of all living beings, nurturer of devotion, of magnanimous valor, Lord of Brahmadham, and Purushottam Bhagwan. **॥1॥**

May the Lord, whose form is full of boundless compassion and bliss in Golok, the Brahmadham, protect me. He has re-established the path of eternal Dharma on earth in the Kosal region, which had been destroyed by the guru of demons. I meditate in my heart upon Shri Krishna, known as Swaminarayan, who has manifested in human form with devotion and Dharma, who removes the worldly bondage of all beings, and who destroys the impurities of Kaliyuga. **॥2॥**

Victory to the illustrious Sahajanand Swami, the true Jagadguru! Merely by taking refuge at His feet, the bonds of worldly existence are immediately severed. **॥3॥**

By His grace upon His devotees, that Lord uproots the entire web of their doubts and spoke numerous nectar-like words filled with personal experiences and complete devotion. **॥4॥**

For the benefit of all, two hundred Vachanamruts and additionally fifty-two more – totaling two hundred and fifty-two – were written by holy persons (Muktanand Swami and others) exactly as heard, in clear words, to the best of their ability. **॥5॥**

By the command of that Lord and for His pleasure, I, Shatanand Muni, compose all those speech-nectars in beautiful, generous, and clear verses. **॥6॥**
