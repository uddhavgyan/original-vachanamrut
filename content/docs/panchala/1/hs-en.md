### 127th Tarang - Panchala 1
<!-- ### Shri Harivakya Sudhasindhu Commentary – By Contemplation: The Insignificance of Worldly Pleasures & The Supreme Greatness of Shri Krishna’s Bliss -->

---

According to the Shaka era, in Vikram Samvat counted as naga (7), ashva (7), vasu (8) and bhūmi (1) — thus making Samvat 1877, on the fourth day of the bright fortnight (Shukla Chaturthi) of Phalguna month, these ambrosial words of Lord Shri Hari were revealed. **॥1॥**

At that time, in the Panchala region, at the residence of King Hemanta (Jiinabhai), Lord Shri Hari, clad in fine white garments, was seated on a grand throne placed upon a vast platform. **॥2॥**

The Lord was surrounded by vairāgīs (renunciates), householders, and devotees who had come from various countries. After the evening āratī had concluded, He inquired of those great virtuous souls. **॥3॥**

By a devotee who is firmly established in dharma and who bears love for <mark1>Lakshmipati Shri Krishna</mark1>, what kind of contemplation should be cultivated in order to completely abandon all worldly affection (attachment)? **॥4॥**

What is that contemplation by which the five sense-objects (sound, touch, form, taste, and smell), though appearing delightful, become insignificant or come under one’s control — please tell me that contemplation. **॥5॥**

When thus questioned, those great saints each expressed their own settled conviction. Having heard them all completely, the Lord spoke. **॥6॥**

“I have heard your thoughts, and My own thought is also fixed. Now I shall tell it to you exactly as it is — listen with full attention.” **॥7॥**

<mark>If one contemplates Shri Krishna’s bliss in accordance with the statements of the true scriptures, then certainly all pleasure derived from illusory objects becomes utterly insignificant.</mark> **॥8॥**

In reality, through the authoritative statements of the true scriptures, the great men of ancient times also conclusively determined that <mark1>Shri Krishna’s bliss</mark1> is supremely great and all other pleasures are insignificant. **॥9॥**

In the Mahabharata, Puranas, and similar scriptures, Shri Krishna is described as having form, and for this very reason He is also declared to be the Lord who is the creator of the world’s creation, etc. **॥10॥**

That which is existence-consciousness-bliss by nature, nirguṇa (beyond the three modes of material nature), akṣara (imperishable), beginningless and endless (without beginning and without end) Brahman — that very Brahman is declared to be the abode of the Supreme Truth (Paramātman). **॥11॥**

That self-luminous Lord joins living entities, who have arisen from māyā, with intellect, senses, mind, and vital airs. **॥12॥**

Thereafter, the Lord creates superior, middling, and inferior enjoyments for those living entities and also arranges all the places of enjoyment for those pleasures. **॥13॥**

From Brahmā down to the tiniest insect, all embodied beings enjoy those pleasures in sequence according to their own past actions. **॥14॥**

The five superior sense-objects created there by the Lord are actually meant only for the pacification of the suffering born from inferior sense-enjoyments. **॥15॥**

Just as a wise and wealthy merchant plants shady trees on both sides of the road for the comfort of poor travelers. **॥16॥**

And arranges water-houses, beautiful rest-houses, and appropriate food-distribution stalls at various places along the way. **॥17॥**

In the same way, <mark1>Shri Krishna</mark1> also creates delightful sense-objects for the pleasure of certain demigods and human beings (those who are virtuous). **॥18॥**

In the presence of Lord Hari, the supreme master of countless millions of universes, even great personalities like Brahmā and Indra are like paupers. **॥19॥**

Just as intelligent people, upon seeing the comforts provided for travelers on the road, conclude that the householder’s domestic comfort must be far greater than that. **॥20॥**

In the same manner, upon beholding the delightful sense-pleasures of souls like Brahmā and Indra, those who study the true scriptures understand the <mark1>Krishna-tattva</mark1> described therein to be far superior to that. **॥21॥**

Wise persons, through constant service to the true scriptures, come to know that the <mark1>bliss of Bhagavad-dhāma</mark1> is immensely greater than all other pleasures. **॥22॥**

Through this very contemplation, for the person who lovingly performs bhajana of <mark1>Lakshmipati Shri Krishna</mark1>, even delightful sense-objects become insignificant. **॥23॥**

Whatever intense sense-pleasure any embodied being obtains is itself the fruit of dharma performed with devotion in the past. **॥24॥**

<mark>The bliss that eternally exists in Shri Krishna Himself is never obtained by anyone, anywhere, at any time.</mark> **॥25॥**

Just as there is great light near a lamp, but not at a distance — then how could there be any at a great distance? **॥26॥**

In the same way, the kind of bliss a devotee receives when staying close to the complete <mark1>Ānandanidhi Shri Krishna</mark1> is not obtained when remaining far away. **॥27॥**

Therefore, an intelligent devotee should carefully conduct himself in such a way that his life remains always in the proximity of <mark1>Shri Krishna</mark1>. **॥28॥**

Those who become attached to charming worldly objects and then become separated from them perish along with those objects — their desires having already been destroyed by time. **॥29॥**

Therefore, completely abandoning any kind of affection (attachment) toward time-bound illusory objects (worldly pleasures created by māyā), those discerning (wise) devotees engage in the bhakti of Him (the Supreme Lord) alone — no matter how charming those (worldly things) may appear. **॥30॥**

The pleasure of a king is greater than that of ordinary men; the pleasure of the demigods is greater than that of kings; Indra’s pleasure is greater than that of the demigods; and Brahmā’s pleasure is greater than Indra’s. **॥31॥**

Greater still is the pleasure of Virāṭ Puruṣa, greater than that is the pleasure of Pradhāna-Puruṣa, and greater even than that is the pleasure of the master of primordial nature (Mūla-Puruṣa). **॥32॥**

Even greater is the bliss of Akṣara Brahman — so it is sung in the Vedas and other scriptures; therefore the bliss of <mark1>Shri Krishna</mark1> is indeed an ocean of bliss. **॥33॥**

Thus, when one contemplates the boundless bliss of the Lord, all other pleasures apart from that appear utterly insignificant in my opinion. **॥34॥**

One whose intellect is pure becomes completely indifferent toward vulgar as well as charming pleasures through such contemplation. **॥35॥**

Such a wise person is dear to Me, because he has no taste for anything other than <mark1>Shri Krishna’s bliss</mark1>. **॥36॥**

You all are also wise saints, therefore accept this contemplation — it is superior to all other contemplations for you. **॥37॥**

For the person desiring liberation in whose mind this contemplation becomes firm, even if situated in a dreadful forest, he considers himself surrounded by a crowd of people. **॥38॥**

And the same person, even if situated in Indraloka, still considers himself to be in a forest; he never feels happy with that pleasure. **॥39॥**

O discerning saintly persons, you who are free from household life — joyfully and firmly adopt this contemplation, which bestows the perfect attainment of Hari’s bliss. Having thus drunk the nectar of Hari’s words, uttering “Om” (or accepting with “tathāstu”), with joyful hearts they offered loving obeisances to the Lord. **॥40॥**
