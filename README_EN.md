# Original Vachanamrut

The goal of this project is to make the original and pure Vachanamrut of Lord Shri Swaminarayan (Shriji Maharaj) available in digital form along with the Sanskrit commentary (Setumala).

## About the Project

The Vachanamrut is the primary scripture of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, containing 262 discourses of Shriji Maharaj. Over time, changes occurred in manuscripts, so to preserve the original purity:

- Sadguru Shatanand Muni translated the original Gujarati Vachanamrut into Sanskrit, creating the text **Shriharivakyasudhasindhu**.
- The first Acharya of the Vadtal Gadi, Shri Raghuvirji Maharaj, wrote an extensive Sanskrit commentary on it called **Setumala**.

This project presents the original Sanskrit text, Setumala commentary, and translations in Gujarati, Hindi, and English together. The website is built using the Hugo static site generator, and all content is stored in Markdown files within the `content/` folder.
